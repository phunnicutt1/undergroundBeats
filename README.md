# Underground Beats

A professional-grade electronic music production application written in C++ using the JUCE framework.

## Project Overview

Underground Beats is a digital audio workstation (DAW) designed for electronic music production. It features a powerful synthesis engine, pattern-based sequencer, effects processing, and a flexible routing architecture - all with a focus on low-latency performance and intuitive workflow.

## Features

- **Audio Engine**: Real-time audio processing with minimal latency
- **Synthesis**: Multiple oscillator types, ADSR envelopes, and filters
- **Effects**: Delay, reverb, and more
- **Sequencer**: Pattern-based sequencing with MIDI support
- **Project System**: Save and load your projects
- **User Interface**: Tabbed layout with mixer, sequencer, and dedicated controls for each component

## Building from Source

See [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on building and running the application.
