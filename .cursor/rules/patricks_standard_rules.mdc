## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions or methods
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects
