## Current Focus

\[2025-04-03 15:50:39\] - Refactored JUCE entry point: Removed conflicting `START_JUCE_APPLICATION` from `src/core/main.cpp` and refined `CMakeLists.txt` source list for clarity. `src/Main.cpp` is now the sole entry point.

\[2025-04-03 16:17:17\] - Implemented `UndergroundBeatsProcessor` (.h/.cpp) with basic sine wave generation. Temporarily returning `nullptr` from `createEditor` until `MainEditor` is implemented.

## Recent Changes

\[2025-04-04 08:36:13\] - Implemented per-stem Gain effect in `UndergroundBeatsProcessor`, adding dynamic gain parameters and applying them in `processBlock`.

\[2025-04-04 20:14:36\] - Implemented basic Left Sidebar UI (`SidebarComponent`) with placeholder ListBox and integrated it into `MainComponent` layout.

\[2025-04-04 20:30:06\] - Implemented basic Top Bar UI (`TopBarComponent`) with placeholder buttons and integrated it into `MainComponent` layout, adjusting `resized()`.
