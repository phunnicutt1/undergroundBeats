- **Frequency modulation**: Supports real-time frequency modulation for FM synthesis techniques
- **Wavetable support**: Allows loading custom wavetables for advanced sound design

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Each waveform type has a specialized generation method optimized for quality and performance
- Phase accumulation approach ensures sample-accurate frequency tracking
- Linear interpolation for wavetable playback provides smooth synthesis
- Efficient processing of sample buffers with optional modulation input

### 2. Envelope

The `Envelope` class implements an ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope generator for amplitude and modulation control.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Sample-accurate timing**: Precise control over envelope timing for consistent results
- **Shaped curves**: Uses shaped curves (cubic, exponential) for more musical envelope shapes
- **Flexible processing**: Can process individual samples or entire buffers
- **Multiple application modes**: Can be used for amplitude, filter modulation, or other parameters

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Proper filter state reset to avoid artifacts when resetting

### 4. SynthVoice

The `SynthVoice` class combines oscillators, envelopes, and filters into a complete synthesis voice.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Component integration**: Integrates multiple synthesis components into a coherent voice
- **Parameter mapping**: Maps control parameters to appropriate synthesis components
- **Efficient resource usage**: Manages synthesis resources efficiently for a single voice
- **MIDI control**: Translates MIDI note information into synthesis parameters

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Supports dual oscillators with detune for richer sounds
- Implements separate envelopes for amplitude and filter cutoff
- Handles voice state management (active/inactive)
- Processes audio at sample level for highest quality

### 5. SynthModule

The `SynthModule` class manages multiple synthesis voices for polyphonic playback.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Voice management**: Handles allocation and deallocation of synthesis voices
- **Voice stealing**: Implements voice stealing algorithm for when all voices are in use
- **Parameter broadcast**: Efficiently updates parameters across all voices
- **MIDI processing**: Processes MIDI events and routes them to appropriate voices

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Configurable polyphony with dynamic voice allocation
- Common parameter interface for controlling all voices simultaneously
- Efficient MIDI event handling and voice assignment
- Stereo output support with proper mixing of all active voices

## Performance Optimizations

The synthesis engine implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Buffer-based processing**: Processes audio in blocks for improved CPU efficiency
2. **Minimal allocations**: Avoids memory allocations in the audio path
3. **Efficient algorithms**: Uses optimized algorithms for waveform generation and filtering
4. **Resource sharing**: Shares common resources across voices to reduce memory usage

## Thread Safety Considerations

The synthesis components are designed to be used within the audio thread and follow these principles:

1. **No locks**: Avoids locks and other blocking operations in audio processing methods
2. **Parameter smoothing**: Implements parameter smoothing to prevent artifacts during parameter changes
3. **State consistency**: Maintains consistent internal state during processing

## Integration with Audio Engine

The synthesis components integrate with the audio engine through these mechanisms:

1. **Processor nodes**: Synthesis modules can be added as nodes in the processor graph
2. **Parameter automation**: Synthesis parameters can be automated through the audio engine
3. **MIDI routing**: MIDI data is routed from the audio engine to the synthesis module

## Future Enhancements

The synthesis engine design allows for these future enhancements:

1. **Additional oscillator types**: Support for more complex waveform generation techniques
2. **Advanced modulation**: Implementation of an LFO and modulation matrix system
3. **Extended filter types**: Additional filter types and filter chaining
4. **Improved voice allocation**: More sophisticated voice stealing algorithms
5. **SIMD optimization**: Vectorized processing for improved performance

## Design Patterns Used

The synthesis engine implementation utilizes these design patterns:

1. **Factory method**: For creating different types of oscillators and filters
2. **Strategy pattern**: For different waveform generation and filtering strategies
3. **Composite pattern**: For combining multiple components into more complex structures
4. **Observer pattern**: For parameter updates across multiple components

## Testing Strategy

The synthesis components are tested using:

1. **Unit tests**: Verify correct behavior of individual synthesis components
2. **Audio quality tests**: Validate the audio quality of the generated signals
3. **Performance tests**: Measure CPU usage under various polyphony loads
4. **Integration tests**: Verify proper integration with the audio engine
