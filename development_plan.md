*   Integrate models using ONNX or similar, converting them for C++ execution with onnxruntime for efficiency.

**Develop the variation explorer UI**

*   Create a carousel or grid to display generated variations, using JUCE components for layout and navigation.
*   Allow preview and selection of variations, with small waveforms or spectrograms for visual feedback, enhancing user interaction.

#### Phase 6: AI-Assisted Composition

**Set up a recommendation system**

*   Analyze track features using Librosa [Librosa Audio and Music Analysis Library](https://librosa.org) or Essentia [Essentia Audio Analysis Library](https://essentia.upf.edu) for tempo, key, and common effects.
