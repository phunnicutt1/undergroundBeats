# Underground Beats: Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the current implementation status of the Underground Beats project, highlighting completed components, work in progress, and planned future development. It serves as a companion to the DESIGN.md document.

## Recent Updates - Achieving Buildable Status

To bring the project to a buildable state, the following tasks were completed:

1. **Fixed Component Integration Issues**:
   - Resolved conflicting audio engine implementations by standardizing on `Engine.h`
   - Fixed namespace issues between UndergroundBeats namespace and global scope
   - Added proper initialization of UI components in constructor initialization lists

2. **Implemented Missing Components**:
   - Created AppComponent files to serve as the main application container
   - Implemented basic versions of PatternEditor and PatternControlPanel 
   - Added stub implementations for complex functionality to be completed later
   - Ensured MixerView works with the existing audio engine

3. **Added Build Infrastructure**:
   - Created build and run scripts for easier development
   - Updated CMakeLists.txt to include all necessary source files
   - Fixed file path references and class declarations

4. **Enhanced UI Integration**:
   - Added mixer interface with channel strips and routing capabilities
   - Integrated new tabs in the main interface
   - Ensured all UI components resize correctly
   - Connected audio engine to UI controls

These changes have resulted in a buildable prototype with basic functionality, ready for further feature implementation and refinement.
